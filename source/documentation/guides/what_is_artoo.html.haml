%h2 What is artoo?
%p Artoo is a micro-framework for robotics. It provides a simple, but powerful Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for robots and physical computing.
%p  With Artoo, you can easily connect multiple, different hardware devices together at the same time into a single solution. Artoo makes telling robots what to do incredibly simple and fun.
%p
  Ruby versions supported: Ruby 2.0, Ruby 1.9.3, JRuby 1.7.4, and Rubinius 2.0
  Artoo is conceptualy influenced by Sinatra (
  = link_to "Sinatra", "https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra"
  ) as well as borrowing some code from it.
  Artoo provides a robust actor-based messaging architecture, that can support fully multi-threaded
  operation and high-concurrency, as long as it is supported by the Ruby version in which it is executing.
%p
  This means you will need to use JRuby or Rubinius for maximum concurrency.
  To a large extent, this is due to being built on top of Celluloid (
  = link_to "Celluloid", "https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid"
  ), Celluloid::IO (
  = link_to "Celluloid::IO", "https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io"
  ), and Reel (

  ).
