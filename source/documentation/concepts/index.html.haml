%h2 API

%p When you create an application with artoo, you can use its public interface to monitor robots and receive information from them.

%p 
	Go to 
	= link_to "API Usage" , "/documentation/api" 
	for further information.

%h2 Robot

%p A Robot represents the primary interface for interacting with a collection of physical computing capabilities. A robot has devices plugged into it; you can tell them what to do or receive notifications of events.

%p 
	Go to 
	= link_to "Docs" , "/documentation" 
	for a list of current supported hardware.

%h2 Device-Driver

%p Controls behaviour of a certain device by exposing diferent methods according to its capabilities.
%p Examples: LED in arduino board or sphero accelerometer.

%h2 Connection-Adaptor

%p Controls how we communicate to the device to establish communication with a robot.
%p Example: In arduino, we use the Firmata Adaptor for this.

%h2 Integration

%p This is the low-level layer that establishes communication with the hardware.
%p Current integrations supported: "serial", "serial to socket"
